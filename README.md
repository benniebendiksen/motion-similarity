## On LMA
Laban Movement Analysis is a technique created by Rudolf Laban to formally describe human movement. It is used in a broad range of fields such as dance, physical therapy, drama, psychology, and anthropology. LMA comprises four categories: Body, Effort, Shape, and Space. LMA terms are capitalized.  

LMA practitioners and educators who studied at [LIMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban/Bartenieff_Institute_of_Movement_Studies), an accredited institutional member of the [National Association of Schools of Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Schools_of_Dance) (NASD), are known as "Certified Movement Analysts" (CMAs). Other courses offer LMA studies, including Integrated Movement Studies, which qualifies "Certified Laban/Bartenieff Movement Analysts" (CLMAs). We worked with a CMA and CLMA in the PERFORM project– they are the coauthors Susan Deutsch and Michael Neff. 

**Body** defines the structural aspects of the human body during motion, i.e., what the body is doing and the relationship of the body parts during motion. 

**Effort** is the dynamic component, which is used to describe the characteristics of movement based on humans’ inner attitudes. 

**Shape** determines the way these attitudes are expressed through the body, and it is manifested in postures. 

**Space** describes how a person connects to their environment; locale, directions, and paths of a movement, and it is partly related to steering. 

PERFORM keeps Body and Space fixed and focuses on Shape and Effort components. In fact, it considers Shape regarding its relationship to Effort. So, it wouldn’t be wrong to conclude that we are only focusing on Effort as the dynamic component of LMA in our work.
